NitroPDFReaderDriverx64.exe is an executable file associated with Nitro PDF Reader, a software application developed by Nitro Software that enables users to create, edit, and convert PDF documents in a 64-bit environment. The file is part of version 10.5.9.11 of the software and is generally considered safe, as it originates from a reputable publisher; however, like any executable, it can be falsely flagged by antivirus programs or potentially become compromised if downloaded from untrusted sources. Users have occasionally reported errors related to this file, which may include issues with installation or execution, but these problems are typically linked to system configuration or conflicts with other software rather than the file itself being malicious. It is advisable to ensure that Nitro PDF Reader is downloaded from the official Nitro Software website to avoid any risk of malware and to keep the software updated to mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.
